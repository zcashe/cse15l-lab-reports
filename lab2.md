# Part 3
## What have I learned in the past 2 weeks?
> Before these last 2 labs, I had no idea that it was possible to generate a public and private ssh key, which I can use to log in without my password. I also learned about how queries work in java and how to run a web server. I think the web servers seem interesting and I want to see what else can be done with them. The concept of URIs and URI handling was new to me as well, however I think I have a good grasp of the concept now.
